    This is a demonstration of a multi-page Streamlit application.
    Each bot page in the sidebar represents a separate module
    where you can implement different functionalities or AI models.

    **How to use:**
    - Navigate using the sidebar on the left.
    - Each page (`Bot 1` to `Bot 4`) has its own functionality.
    - You can add more bots by creating new Python files in the `pages` directory.
